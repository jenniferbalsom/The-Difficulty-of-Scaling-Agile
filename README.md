# The Difficulty of Scaling Agile

The Agile development approach no longer requires an introduction due to its success in the software industry: for the past ten years, it appears that everyone has been talking about this modern framework. Recognizing the success that small and mid-sized businesses are achieving via the [use of Agile], an increasing number of major corporations are aiming to embrace this paradigm. Their main worry is that Agile's basic concept appears to contradict everything that companies value. Agile abandons the clumsy business of planning, procedures, tools, and paperwork, leaving multinational businesses wondering how they can reap the advantages of Agile/Scrum without unleashing anarchy among their carefully regulated teams.

Scaling this framework (and others that build on it: Scrum, XP, and so on) is, according to adherents of "real" Agile, actually rather simple: just allow your self-organizing teams and units determine what's best for them, and trust them to improve their own work. While this may be true, it's natural that most managers are apprehensive about relinquishing total authority. Various techniques and frameworks have been developed for them, allowing companies to make the transition to Agile in a pleasant and (more or less) organized manner.

## Scrum on a large scale (LeSS)

Craig Larman and Bas Vodde founded Large-scale Scrum (LeSS) in 2005 to assist businesses in using Scrum in their development. It comprises two frameworks, the first of which applies to smaller businesses (up to ten Scrum teams of seven people each), while Framework-2 works for up to a few thousand employees on a single product.

LeSS may be regarded of as standard Scrum applied at various levels to fit large-scale development: it is a simple framework with a great degree of flexibility in execution. It is not prescriptive and only offers ideas. LeSS expands on "basic" Scrum by recommending the organization of several feature teams under a single Product Owner (PO). Framework-2, also known as LeSS Huge, then adds more APOs (Area POs) to allow for scalability. Sprint Planning sessions assist teams coordinate, and additional meetings may be introduced to enhance cooperation.

LeSS is an excellent solution for small businesses who are rapidly expanding and seeking for a framework to help them scale Scrum as well. It allows for rule flexibility, which is both an advantage and a big risk factor: large businesses may avoid it in favor of a more organized framework.
